    # The geometry of the window:
    #   [{width}]x{height}[+/-{x}+/-{y}]
    # The geometry of the message window.
    # The height is measured in number of notifications everything else
    # in pixels.  If the width is omitted but the height is given
    # ("-geometry x2"), the message window expands over the whole screen
    # (dmenu-like).  If width is 0, the window expands to the longest
    # message displayed.  A positive x is measured from the left, a
    # negative from the right side of the screen.  Y is measured from
    # the top and down respectively.
    # The width can be negative.  In this case the actual width is the
    # screen width minus the width defined in within the geometry option.

    # WAYLAND (from man 5 dunst)
    # If you have your dunst notifications on the same side of your display as
    # your status bar, you might notice that your notifications appear a bit
    # higher or lower than on X11. This is because the notification cannot be
    # placed on top of your status bar. The notifications are placed relative
    # to your status bar, making them appear higher or lower by the height of
    # your status bar. We cannot do anything about that behavior, so you will
    # need to change your geometry variable accordingly.

    #        simplistic so using this option outside of matching rules for
    #        specific applications *IS GREATLY DISCOURAGED*.
    #
    # no:    Disable markup parsing, incoming notifications will be treated as
    #        plain text. Dunst will not advertise that it has the body-markup

    # Possible values are:

#    frame_color
#    fullscreen
#    new_icon
#    set_stack_tag
#    set_transient

#
# Instead of the appname filter, it's recommended to use the desktop_entry filter.
# GLib based applications export their desktop-entry name. In comparison to the appname,
# the desktop-entry won't get localized.
#
# SCRIPTING
# You can specify a script that gets run when the rule matches by
# setting the "script" option.
# The script will be called as follows:
#   script appname summary body icon urgency
# where urgency can be "LOW", "NORMAL" or "CRITICAL".
#
# NOTE: if you don't want a notification to be displayed, set the format
# to "".
# NOTE: It might be helpful to run dunst -print in a terminal in order
# to find fitting options for rules.

# delay: displays the new notification, if there is no fullscreen window active
#        If the notification is already drawn, it won't get undrawn.
